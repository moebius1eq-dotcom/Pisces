# Cosmos Explorer

## PISCES entrance — local review milestone

The homepage previews a 13.3-second camera flight through a deep universe of astronomy-filled jigsaw pieces: close encounters, a dramatic pullback revealing thousands of pieces, convergence, and one final missing piece. The assembled imagery resolves into **PISCES / PIECE TOGETHER THE UNIVERSE** and holds there. Reload the homepage or use **Replay entrance** to review it locally. The preserved Journey remains reachable at `index.html#departure`; atlas URLs are unchanged. See [entrance notes](docs/pisces-entrance.md) for the storyboard, adaptive rendering, readiness, fallbacks and checks, and [image credits](assets/entrance-sources.json) for locally hosted NASA imagery. The homepage/pass-through phase has not been implemented.

Pre-PISCES recovery: annotated tag `pre-pisces-2026-09-12`, branch `codex/pre-pisces`, commit `bc5c693`.

Cosmos Explorer is an interactive astronomy experience built around cinematic scrollytelling. It is designed to make the scale and structure of the universe feel immediate before introducing deeper educational material.

## Current experience

The site includes a perspective 3D camera flight, a planet atlas, a deep-space atlas and an observatory page. The journey spans these observation scales:

1. Earth and Moon
2. Inner Solar System
3. Full Solar System
4. Stellar neighborhood
5. Milky Way
6. Local Group
7. Cosmic web and Laniākea
8. Observable universe

Mouse-wheel impulses now advance a damped scroll target, so the camera continues moving between wheel notches and settles gently. Reversing the wheel cancels previous momentum; keyboard, touch, navigation and reduced-motion scrolling remain native. Scrolling controls scale, position, and opacity. Earth begins as a curved limb, resolves into a full globe, recedes beside the Moon, and then becomes one orbit around the Sun. Each previously enormous structure contracts before the next scale appears. Scrolling upward reverses the same camera path without a section cut.

The Earth-system index stop holds both bodies in frame with the `384,400 KM` mean lunar-distance marker. The end-state return action resolves to this same frame, so its URL, reload state, and visible destination remain consistent.

Earth uses NASA Blue Marble imagery with inverse spherical projection, directional light, a curved terminator, and a thin atmospheric rim. The Moon uses NASA LROC imagery under the same light direction. The later stages use cached procedural renderings for the Sun, orbital systems, stellar neighborhood, spiral galaxies, cosmic web, and observable horizon.

The stellar-neighborhood hold places the Sun and Alpha Centauri beside Proxima Centauri, Barnard's Star, and Sirius. These reference stars contract into the same point as the camera resolves the Milky Way.

The Milky Way hold marks the galactic center and connects it to the Sun in the Orion Spur with an approximate `26,000 LY` measurement. The annotation contracts with the galaxy before the Local Group appears.

The Local Group hold places the Milky Way beside Andromeda and Triangulum, with the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds retained as named Milky Way satellites. Additional dwarf galaxies remain unlabeled to preserve the group scale without filling the frame with interface text.

The 42-viewport timeline gives the opening Earth departure the most weight before gradually accelerating. Planet diameters retain meaningful relative relationships where legible, while separations and later structures are composed for clarity rather than presented as a literal spatial map.

The inner-system hold identifies Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars beside their plotted positions. The full Solar System hold then identifies Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune and resolves the main asteroid belt between the inner and outer planets. Each label set fades before the next scale so the wider journey retains its sparse visual rhythm.

## Navigation and access

The header index jumps to any scale without creating a separate scene. Every destination has a shareable URL fragment and works with browser Back and Forward controls. Manual scrolling updates the current fragment after movement settles. The final frame includes a `RETURN TO EARTH` action that closes the journey into a loop.

A semantic outline exposes the same scale relationships and measurements to assistive technology. The index traps keyboard focus while open, closes with Escape, and marks the active scale. Reduced-motion mode freezes ambient animation while preserving direct scroll control.

## Rendering

The experience uses HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and a locally vendored Three.js 0.170.0 renderer with no build step. The earlier Canvas 2D journey remains available when WebGL is unavailable. Planetary and procedural textures are cached before scrolling, canvas updates are synchronized to display frames, and deterministic stars remain stable across resizing. Animation pauses while the page is hidden.

The first-visit loader waits for both its minimum cinematic duration and planetary surface preparation. If an image is unavailable, shaded fallback spheres keep the journey usable.

## Run locally

No packages or build tools are required. Open this cloned repository in VS Code and serve it with Live Server, or run `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000`.

Use a local HTTP server instead of opening `index.html` directly. Browser security can block the image pixel reads needed for spherical projection on `file://` URLs. If a texture fails, a shaded fallback sphere keeps the journey usable.

## Project structure

```text
index.html   Page structure and accessible content
style.css    Visual system, layout, and transitions
script.js    Loading sequence, starfield, pointer depth, and scroll state
```

## Design direction

The interface combines the quiet precision of a scientific observatory with cinematic space-documentary pacing. The palette stays nearly black and off-white, typography carries the first view, and motion is deliberately subtle. The project avoids card-heavy layouts, saturated neon gradients, decorative HUD clutter, and unnecessary dependencies.

## Object atlas and sharper surfaces

The top navigation connects three actual pages: Journey, Planets and Deep Space. The Planets page gives the Sun, all eight planets, the Moon and Pluto their own persistent close-up. Choose an object by name or with Previous/Next; click its image for a keyboard-accessible facts dialog. Deep Space covers the Milky Way, Andromeda, cosmic web and observable universe. Object URLs preserve the selected object, including browser Back/Forward.

Visible Earth, Moon, Sun, labeled planets and the major galaxies in the journey link to their atlas entries. Tiny planets receive expanded click targets. Keyboard users can reach every object through the Planets/Deep Space navigation. Pluto is presented as a dwarf planet in the atlas rather than adding a misleading ninth planetary orbit to the existing journey.

Earth now uses the 8192×4096 NASA source from the existing SVS attribution above; its cached globe is 2048 pixels across, with a 4096-pixel source sampling limit. The Moon uses a 4096×2048 source and 1024-pixel globe. Atlas Earth/Moon PNGs are cached projections of those same textures. The extreme opening limb still magnifies a finite image; these are globe maps, not surface-level terrain.

Other planet close-ups are locally stored NASA mission images; exact image URLs and reference pages are in `assets/atlas-sources.json`. Images retain their mission processing and are not to a shared scale. The Sun and deep-space atlas visuals are explicitly schematic. Physical values are approximate; planetary parameters follow [NASA/JPL physical parameters](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/phys_par.html). Gravity for giant planets uses a reference atmospheric level. Mass is used instead of weight because weight depends on the local gravitational field.

New files: `planets.html`, `deep-space.html`, `atlas.css`, `atlas.js`, `objects.json`, and `momentum.js`. The site still needs no framework, dependency installation or build step.


## Perspective camera flight

`flight.js` renders textured spherical planets, Saturn's rings, a volumetric stellar disk and a 3D filament network. Authored camera positions follow a centripetal Catmull–Rom path; look-at targets and camera roll change between observation stops. Earth and each of the eight planets receive close passes before the camera climbs above the galactic plane. The Solar System contracts during the transition to the galaxy. This is a composed sequence; sizes and distances are intentionally compressed.

Scroll remains reversible. Play flight advances along the same path over about four minutes; Pause, wheel input, touch, keyboard input, opening navigation or hiding the page stops playback. Reduced-motion mode bypasses wheel momentum; playback starts only when explicitly requested. The persistent object title, Explore link and + marker make inspection discoverable and keyboard accessible. Graphics initialization failure or context loss retains the earlier canvas experience.

The shared hamburger menu (`navigation.js`, `navigation.css`) connects Journey, Planet atlas, Deep space and The observatory. All pages share Inter typography. `observatory.html` documents interaction, scientific interpretation and asset credits.

### New dependencies and credits

- Mercury, Venus atmosphere, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Sun maps: [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/), [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Local files in `assets/maps/` use the site's `textures/download/2k_NAME.jpg` originals. Maps are applied to lit geometry without recoloring. The source includes artistic reconstruction where measured coverage is missing. Credits are also visible on the Observatory page.
- Earth and Moon retain the NASA maps credited above. Saturn's ring shading, galaxies and cosmic-web filaments are procedural illustrations.

Verification for this revision covered deterministic forward/reverse camera samples, play/pause, menu Escape/focus, scale navigation, mobile framing, object links, all separate pages and context-loss fallback. Browser rendering was checked using software WebGL; smoothness on the user's GPU and mouse remains an important local review.


## Refinement audit

The existing journey now uses more distinct stellar populations, irregular galaxy density and dust attenuation, variable filament structure, longer reveal intervals and sparse source-checked measurements. It renders only changed frames and pauses the legacy starfield during the 3D journey. See [the refinement audit](docs/journey-refinement.md) for sources, pacing review, performance measurements and limitations. JOURNEY, PLANETS, DEEP SPACE and the object atlas remain available.


Journey history preserves the exact camera position when opening an atlas entry or reloading. A contextual **Return to journey** link appears in the atlas after a journey visit, using a normalized progress fragment that also survives viewport changes. Fresh home navigation still starts at the hero. Session storage is optional; ordinary navigation remains usable when storage is unavailable.

Window resizing and phone rotation preserve normalized journey progress in both the 3D and fallback renderers. Short landscape screens use a compact caption layout to keep object titles separate from measurements.
